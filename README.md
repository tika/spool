team spool (just me). my goal was to build the next generation of courses by hijacking the dopamine loop of the infinite scroll and redirecting it toward actual human progress. over the weekend, i shipped a native ios swift app with a hono backend and a just-in-time background queue that programmatically builds and injects educational video lessons right before the user bottoms out their feed.

The Team: solo hacker. built the native swift frontend, the hono/sql backend, and the asynchronous background queue that orchestrates the 11labs audio and visual generation pipeline.
